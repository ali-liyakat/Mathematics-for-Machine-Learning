# WHAT IS LINEAR ALGEBRA?
-> Algebra is arithmetic that includes non-numerical entities like x.
        2(x) +5 =10
if it has exponential term, then it isn't linear algeba.
        2(x^2) +5 = 20

-> "Solving for unknowns within system of linear equations"
There are only 3 options in linear algebra: one, no, or infinite solutions.


        y = a + bx1 + cx2 +... +mxm
